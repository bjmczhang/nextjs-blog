However, XML became complex when combined with specifications like DTD, XSD, XPath, and XSLT, making it challenging for developers to work with. In 2002, Douglas Crockford, a senior architect at Yahoo, came up with JSON, a super-lightweight data interchange format, to rescue software engineers from the complexities of XML imposed by giant software companies.\r\n\r\nJSON is actually a subset of JavaScript. It supports a few simple data types:\r\n\r\n- ==number==: same as JavaScript's ==number==.\r\n- ==boolean==: equivalent to ==true== or ==false== in JavaScript.\r\n- ==string==: similar to JavaScript's ==string==.\r\n- ==null==: equivalent to ==null== in JavaScript.\r\n- ==array==: same as JavaScript's ==Array==, represented by ==[]==.\r\n- ==object==: similar to JavaScript's =={ ... }==.\r\n\r\nJSON also enforces that character encoding must be UTF-8 and strings must be enclosed in double quotes. Object keys are also required to be enclosed in double quotes.\r\n\r\nJSON quickly gained popularity in the web world and became an ECMA standard. Almost all programming languages have libraries for parsing JSON, and in JavaScript, JSON is natively supported, making it convenient to use.\r\n\r\nTo serialize any JavaScript object into JSON, you need to convert the object into a JSON-formatted string, allowing it to be transmitted over the network. To deserialize a JSON string into a JavaScript object, you simply parse the JSON string.\r\n\r\n### Serialization\r\n\r\nLet's start by serializing the object `xiaoming` into a JSON-formatted string:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n'use strict';\r\n\r\nvar xiaoming = {\r\n    name: 'Â∞èÊòé',\r\n    age: 14,\r\n    gender: true,\r\n    height: 1.65,\r\n    grade: null,\r\n    'middle-school': '\\\"W3C\\\" Middle School',\r\n    skills: ['JavaScript', 'Java', 'Python', 'Lisp']\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo format the output, you can add parameters to control indentation:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nJSON.stringify(xiaoming, null, '  ');\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result will be:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"Â∞èÊòé\",\r\n  \"age\": 14,\r\n  \"gender\": true,\r\n  \"height\": 1.65,\r\n  \"grade\": null,\r\n  \"middle-school\": \"\\\"W3C\\\" Middle School\",\r\n  \"skills\": [\r\n    \"JavaScript\",\r\n    \"Java\",\r\n    \"Python\",\r\n    \"Lisp\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also provide an array as the second argument to filter specific properties:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nJSON.stringify(xiaoming, ['name', 'skills'], '  ');\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result will be:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"Â∞èÊòé\",\r\n  \"skills\": [\r\n    \"JavaScript\",\r\n    \"Java\",\r\n    \"Python\",\r\n    \"Lisp\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo have more precise control over the serialization process, you can pass a function as the second argument, which will process each key-value pair in the object:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction convert(key, value) {\r\n    if (typeof value === 'string') {\r\n        return value.toUpperCase();\r\n    }\r\n    return value;\r\n}\r\n\r\nJSON.stringify(xiaoming, convert, '  ');\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result will be:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"Â∞èÊòé\",\r\n  \"age\": 14,\r\n  \"gender\": true,\r\n  \"height\": 1.65,\r\n  \"grade\": null,\r\n  \"middle-school\": \"\\\"W3C\\\" MIDDLE SCHOOL\",\r\n  \"skills\": [\r\n    \"JAVASCRIPT\",\r\n    \"JAVA\",\r\n    \"PYTHON\",\r\n    \"LISP\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to precisely control how `xiaoming` is serialized, you can define a `toJSON()` method on `xiaoming` to directly return the data that should be serialized as JSON:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar xiaoming = {\r\n    name: 'Â∞èÊòé',\r\n    age: 14,\r\n    gender: true,\r\n    height: 1.65,\r\n    grade: null,\r\n    'middle-school': '\\\"W3C\\\" Middle School',\r\n    skills: ['JavaScript', 'Java', 'Python', 'Lisp'],\r\n    toJSON: function () {\r\n        return { // Only output name and age, and change the keys:\r\n            'Name': this.name,\r\n            'Age': this.age\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\nJSON.stringify(xiaoming); // '{\"Name\":\"Â∞èÊòé\",\"Age\":14}'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Deserialization\r\n\r\nTo parse a JSON-formatted string and convert it back to a JavaScript object, you can use `JSON.parse()`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nJSON.parse('[1,2,3,true]'); // [1, 2, 3, true]\r\nJSON.parse('{\"name\":\"Â∞èÊòé\",\"age\":14}'); // Object {name: 'Â∞èÊòé', age: 14}\r\nJSON.parse('true'); // true\r\nJSON.parse('123.45'); // 123.45\r\n```\r\n\r\n`JSON.parse()` also accepts a function as the second argument, which can be used to transform the parsed properties:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n'use strict';\r\n\r\nvar obj = JSON.parse('{\"name\":\"Â∞èÊòé\",\"age\":14}', function (key, value) {\r\n    if (key === 'name') {\r\n        return value + 'ÂêåÂ≠¶';\r\n    }\r\n    return value;\r\n});\r\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(obj)); // {name: 'Â∞èÊòéÂêåÂ≠¶', age: 14}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing JSON in JavaScript is that simple!","tags":"json,javascript","selected":"true"},{"id":6,"title":"WiFi's Successor - LiFi","author":"No Author Given","date":"4-08-2023","content":"\r\nIn June this year, the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) approved the 802.11bb standard, which is a communication protocol for **Light Fidelity (LiFi)**. LiFi enables internet access through light, and the \"L\" in LiFi stands for Light.\r\n\r\n![img](/assets/bg2023073105.webp)\r\n\r\nThough there hasn't been much coverage, LiFi is a fascinating technology worth exploring.\r\n\r\nFirstly, let's understand what LiFi is all about.\r\n\r\nAs we know, WiFi uses radio waves to modulate internet signals and transmit data wirelessly. However, instead of using radio waves, LiFi modulates internet signals into light waves, using optical communication for internet access.\r\n\r\nThere are several significant advantages to transmitting wireless signals through light waves:\r\n\r\n### 1. Enormous Bandwidth:\r\n\r\nWiFi operates at frequencies of 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, possibly extending to 6 GHz. On the other hand, light waves have frequencies ranging from 430 THz to 750 THz, which is orders of magnitude higher than WiFi. Higher frequencies allow for a much larger number of loaded signals and result in an unimaginably high bandwidth. However, higher frequencies also mean weaker penetration through walls.\r\n\r\n### 2. No Radio Interference:\r\n\r\nLiFi can be used in any setting sensitive to radio waves, such as airplanes and operating rooms, as it does not cause radio interference. Additionally, light does not pose any radiation hazards and is harmless to the human body.\r\n\r\n### 3. No Spectrum Resource Limitations:\r\n\r\nUnlike radio waves that require frequency band allocations, light waves have abundant spectrum resources.\r\n\r\n### 4. Low Technical Complexity:\r\n\r\nThe modulation and demodulation of light waves are not technically complex, allowing manufacturers to swiftly produce LiFi products at reasonable costs.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that Oppo applied for a LiFi smartphone patent as early as 2020, and there are already dedicated LiFi transmitters for laptops that can be connected via USB.\r\n\r\n![img](/assets/bg2023073108.webp)\r\n\r\nHowever, LiFi also has some challenges that need to be addressed.\r\n\r\nThe most significant issue is that LiFi requires light-emitting bulbs for internet access. This means that when the lights are turned off, there will be no signal.\r\n\r\n![img](/assets/bg2023073109.webp)\r\n\r\nMoreover, the signal receiver needs to be directly facing the light source, and the distance must not exceed a few meters. Some reports suggest a maximum range of 3 meters.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the question arises on how to handle data upload. Clearly, internet-enabled devices such as smartphones and computers would need to have light bulbs to transmit data.\r\n\r\nConsidering these limitations, LiFi cannot replace WiFi entirely; instead, it serves as a complement and is suitable for specific scenarios that require extremely high bandwidth.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the idea of accessing the internet through light bulbs is captivating and almost futuristic. With LiFi now an international standard, we hope to see practical products in the market soon.\r\n","tags":"internet","selected":"true"}]
