In June this year, the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) approved the 802.11bb standard, which is a communication protocol for **Light Fidelity (LiFi)**. LiFi enables internet access through light, and the "L" in LiFi stands for Light.

Though there hasn't been much coverage, LiFi is a fascinating technology worth exploring.

Firstly, let's understand what LiFi is all about.

As we know, WiFi uses radio waves to modulate internet signals and transmit data wirelessly. However, instead of using radio waves, LiFi modulates internet signals into light waves, using optical communication for internet access.

There are several significant advantages to transmitting wireless signals through light waves:

### 1. Enormous Bandwidth:

WiFi operates at frequencies of 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, possibly extending to 6 GHz. On the other hand, light waves have frequencies ranging from 430 THz to 750 THz, which is orders of magnitude higher than WiFi. Higher frequencies allow for a much larger number of loaded signals and result in an unimaginably high bandwidth. However, higher frequencies also mean weaker penetration through walls.

### 2. No Radio Interference:

LiFi can be used in any setting sensitive to radio waves, such as airplanes and operating rooms, as it does not cause radio interference. Additionally, light does not pose any radiation hazards and is harmless to the human body.

### 3. No Spectrum Resource Limitations:

Unlike radio waves that require frequency band allocations, light waves have abundant spectrum resources.

### 4. Low Technical Complexity:

The modulation and demodulation of light waves are not technically complex, allowing manufacturers to swiftly produce LiFi products at reasonable costs.

It's worth noting that Oppo applied for a LiFi smartphone patent as early as 2020, and there are already dedicated LiFi transmitters for laptops that can be connected via USB.

However, LiFi also has some challenges that need to be addressed.

The most significant issue is that LiFi requires light-emitting bulbs for internet access. This means that when the lights are turned off, there will be no signal.

Moreover, the signal receiver needs to be directly facing the light source, and the distance must not exceed a few meters. Some reports suggest a maximum range of 3 meters.

Additionally, the question arises on how to handle data upload. Clearly, internet-enabled devices such as smartphones and computers would need to have light bulbs to transmit data.

Considering these limitations, LiFi cannot replace WiFi entirely; instead, it serves as a complement and is suitable for specific scenarios that require extremely high bandwidth.

In conclusion, the idea of accessing the internet through light bulbs is captivating and almost futuristic. With LiFi now an international standard, we hope to see practical products in the market soon.
