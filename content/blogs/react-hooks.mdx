## What Are React Hooks?

👉 Special built-in functions that allow us to "hook" into React internals:

- Creating and accessing state from Fiber tree
- Registering side effects in Fiber tree
- Manual DOM selections
- Many more...

> The Fiber tree is somewhere deep inside React, and usually not accessible to us. But using the useState or the useEffect hook, we can essentially hook into that internal mechanism.

👉 Always start with "use" (useState, useEffect, etc.)

👉 Enable easy reusing of non-visual logic: We can compose multiple hooks into our own custom hooks

👉 Give function components the ability to own state and run side effects at different points (before v16.8 only available in class components)

## Overview of All Built-in Hooks

| MOST USED     | LESS USED              | ONLY FOR LIBRARIES      |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| ✅ useState   | ➡️ useRef              | ❌ useSyncExternalStore |
| ✅ useEffect  | ➡️ useCallback         | ❌ useInsertonEffect    |
| ➡️ useReducer | ➡️ useMemo             |                         |
| ➡️ useContext | ➡️ useTransition       |                         |
|               | ➡️ useDeferredValue    |                         |
|               | ❌ useLayoutEffect     |                         |
|               | ❌ useDebugValue       |                         |
|               | ❌ useImperativeHandle |                         |
|               | ❌ useId               |                         |

## The Rules of Hooks

#### 1. Only call hooks at the top level

​ 👉 Do **NOT** call hooks inside **conditionals, loops, nested functions**, or after an **early return**

​ 👉 This is necessary to ensure that hooks are always called in the **same order** (hooks rely on this)

#### 2. Only call hooks from React functions

​ 👉 Only call hooks inside a **function component** or a **custom hook**

> These rules are automatically enforced by React's ESLint rules
